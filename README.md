# RegistrationForm
**This is a simple registration form using react**

* A Component with email,password,confrim password and register button.
* Rules to be implmented.
    - User Name must be 8 characters and above.
    - Password should be 8 characters and above.
    - Confirm password should be equal to the password 
    - Register button must only be enabled if all rules are satisfied
    - error msg div at the top, show error msgs if any.


### Steps taken
In two ways i have implemented this functionality,
- Using Fomik and Yup
- React Hooks.

Although there are  scopes of improvement in current code which I was not able to cover due to time constraints.
I also tried to cover the topics realted to test using Jest and enzyme by writing downfew test case, but due 
mismatch of verison between enzyme and React i was getting few errors, which took some time to get resolved.

I will continue to update it, in future too.
